REANALYSING EEG DATA OF ALZHEIMER AND FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA PATIENTS 

This repository contains the scripts for the reanalysis of resting state EEF data of 
Miltiadous et al. (2023), 'A dataset of EEG recordings from: Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal 
dementia and Healthy subjects', carried out for the course 'Case Studies of Experimental 
Psychology' of Ghent University. In this project, the mean alpha wave power was extracted and 
compared between participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 
healthy controls (CON) for five predetermined ROI's. 

The preprocessed data can be downloaded here, from the folder 'derivatives':
